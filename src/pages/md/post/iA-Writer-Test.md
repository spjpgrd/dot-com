# iA Writer Test

Having the `pages` directory as a location from within [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). Will it work? Probably.

I'm assuming creating a new folder within `/pages` would create a new URL part.

Needs to be a `.md` file format.

What happens if I update it over in VS Code?

Cool. It works.

Filename is probably going to blow things up since it has spaces.

And now testing that folder thing. Yep.

Added a link, but now feeling like the link

Just wasted 45 minutes figuring out stupid things. I've forgotten so much ðŸ˜…
